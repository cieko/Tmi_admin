# Nuxt.js Project Folder Structure

This is the typical folder structure for a production-ready Nuxt.js project.


## Key Folders and Their Purpose

- **`assets/`**: Used for global styles (CSS/SCSS), images, and other media. The contents are processed by Webpack (e.g., minified, optimized).
  
- **`components/`**: Contains Vue components, which are small building blocks used across pages or layouts.
  
- **`layouts/`**: Layouts define the structure of pages (e.g., a default layout, admin layout). You can set different layouts for different pages in your `pages/` directory.

- **`pages/`**: This is where you define your page components. Nuxt.js automatically generates routes based on this directory structure.

- **`plugins/`**: Used to integrate third-party libraries or extend functionality within Nuxt. The plugins are loaded before the root Vue instance is created.

- **`store/`**: If you're using Vuex for state management, this is where the store-related files are located.

- **`public/`**: Contains files that should be directly accessible by the browser (e.g., images, favicon, etc.). Files here are not processed by Webpack.

- **`dist/`**: The output folder for the built production files after running `nuxt build`. It contains everything that will be deployed.

- **`server/`**: For advanced usage, like creating custom server-side functionality or API routes.

- **`nuxt.config.js`**: The Nuxt configuration file, where you can define settings such as the build process, routing behavior, plugins, and environment variables.

This structure is flexible and can vary depending on the specific needs of your project. For example, in a larger application, you might have additional folders for things like types, helpers, or services.
